## Step 2: Job and Type, Compute and Storage

**Objective**: Provide job details, choose the job type, and configure compute and storage options.

**Fields**:
- **Job name**: Enter a name for your job (e.g., "import").
- **Choose a job type**:
  - **Import into Amazon S3**: AWS will ship an empty device to you for storage and compute workloads. Transfer your data onto it and ship it back. After AWS receives it, your data will be moved.
  - **Export from Amazon S3**: AWS will load data from your S3 buckets onto a device and ship it to you. Ship the device back after use for data erasure.
  - **Local compute and storage only**: Perform local tasks without data transfer.

**Action**: 
1. Select "Import into Amazon S3".
2. Choose "Snowball Edge Storage Optimized with 210TB".
